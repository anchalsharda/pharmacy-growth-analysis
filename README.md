**üîç Project Overview:**

Conducted a business viability and growth analysis of the pharmacy department for a major general merchandise retailer in Portugal. The analysis supports strategic expansion decisions between mini-superstore formats and specialized neighborhood markets, using 2019 transactional data from multiple retail locations.
**üß† Key Responsibilities & Skills Demonstrated:**

**ETL & Data Consolidation:**
Extracted, transformed, and loaded multiple raw datasets (bill_fact, dim_customer, dim_doctor, dim_payment_method, dim_store) into a consolidated flat file simulating a data warehouse structure.
Joined datasets using unique IDs and established primary/foreign key relationships.
Standardized data types, resolved missing values, addressed duplicates, and harmonized column formats for consistency.

**Data Preparation & Modeling:**
Created an "Analysis File" from the Flat File, removing redundant fields and focusing on variables relevant to pharmacy performance metrics.
Engineered new variables (e.g., revenue per transaction, volume of prescriptions) to support profitability and stability analysis.
Segmented stores by city and store type to model pharmacy department performance under different market conditions.

**Business Analysis & Recommendations:**
Developed and answered 6-8 critical business questions, such as identifying top-performing stores, analyzing return rates, and evaluating revenue per square foot.
Linked findings to stakeholder requirements regarding store format decisions and departmental focus areas.
Highlighted cities and store types with the strongest pharmacy department performance and revenue stability.

**Data Visualization & Reporting:**
Created supporting charts, pivot tables, and summary statistics to illustrate pharmacy department trends across multiple regions.
Developed a written stakeholder report (and/or presentation) clearly outlining insights, assumptions, recommendations, and potential next steps.

**‚úÖ Key Outcomes:**
Delivered a stakeholder-ready analysis connecting pharmacy department performance to future store expansion strategies.
Provided actionable recommendations to prioritize pharmacy investments in targeted cities and store types.
Demonstrated a full ETL pipeline and real-world business analytics, from raw data extraction to stakeholder communication.
Strengthened the decision-making framework for optimizing revenue growth and operational efficiency in a transforming retail environment.

**üíª Tools Used:**

*Advanced Microsoft Excel: Utilized for data analysis, transformation, and visualization. *Power Query: For efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). *Pivot Tables: To summarize, explore, and analyze large datasets interactively. *What-If Analysis: Including Data Tables and Scenario Manager to model hypothetical business scenarios. *Conditional Formatting & Dynamic Dashboards: For enhanced visual insights. *VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, IFERROR, and Nested Functions: For robust data manipulation and accuracy checks.
